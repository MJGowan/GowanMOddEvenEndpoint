Odd or Even - Endpoint
Create a web api that, when a number is entered into the URL, will return whether the number is odd or even

Peer review: Christopher Prado 26OCT22: I enjoyed running this program on the postman. I chose my favorite number and it guessed even correctly. The program even provided a link so that I could utilize a 'cheat sheet' if necessary. Great work! Go Slytherin house

INSTRUCTIONS
Before anything, open the code in VSCode and run/debug the code. This should lead to a new tab opening, labelled localhost. Copy and paste the URL from that new tab, into the Postman "GET" area. Then, add to the end of the URL like this:
https://localhost:xxxx/OddEven/Numbers/x
The xxxx should be the 4-digit number individual to your computer. Then you wil have /OddEven/Numbers, and in the next space I have labelled with x, you will enter a number. Then, hit "Send". Text should appear stating whether the number you entered is even or odd.
